# FullStackReact
This project is based on the Tasks project by Juan Pablo de la Torre, included in his course of React Native.

## API Database with GraphQl
You can run it with the following command:
`npm run dev`

It will expose your api at http://localhost:4000

I recommend you a program as MongoDB Compass to control and see your database up and running

## Mobile App
It's a React Native app, where you can create users and create, update and remove projects and tasks.
Make sure that you have install all the modules before the execution.

To run the app on your IOS emulator, please run: npx react-native run-ios
